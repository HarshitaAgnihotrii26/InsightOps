Place your image assets here so they are served at `/images/<name>`.

Required files:
- logo.jpeg — main app logo (recommended: 200x200 or a square image)
- background.jpeg — large background image (recommended: 1600x1200 or similar)

Tips:
- For best results, use compressed JPEGs.
- Replace these files with your actual images; the app references `/images/logo.jpeg` and `/images/background.jpeg`.
